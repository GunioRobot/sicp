;; the above examples should be read as follows:
;; (add-1 zero) returns the function which represents 1.
;; i.e. You apply inc once to 0 and that yields 1.
;; in the second example, we apply inc once to 1, and
;; that yields 2. This is just to convert Churl numeral
;; definition to roman numeral definition.

;; as said in the hint, using substitution to evaluate (add-1 zero)
;; tells us that (add-1 zero) == one has one composition of (f x)
;; and (add-1 (add-1 zero)) == 1 is (f (f x)), so here is their formal
;; definition.

;; (add-1 one) => two. Apply inc twice on 1 => 3
;; similarly the other examples.

;; Definition of an add operator
;; To do m + n, we should have a function which is applied f, n+m times.
;;
;; i.e.
;;
;; (m f) = takes a function f and composes a new function which composes
;; f, m times and applies this new function to x.
;;
;; (lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((m f) ((n f) x)))) will create this new
;; function which compose a given function n+m times and hence is equiv
;; to addition of m+n. Some simple repl experiments seem to verify the
;; result.
(defn add [m n]
  (fn [f] (fn [x]

(comment
(((add one two) inc) 1)
;;=> 4
)

;; another definition of add is this:
;; m + n == (m + [1 + 1 + 1 + ... ]
(defn new-add [m n]
  ((m add-1) n))

;; continueing the same logic, (add one two) => three
;; and inc applied three times to 1 is 4. This proves
;; that our definition of add is correct.

;; I used the wikipedia article to study Church Numerals:
