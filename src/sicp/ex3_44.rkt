;; Consider the problem of transferring an amount from one account to

;; following procedure, even if there are multiple people concurrently
;; transferring money among multiple accounts, using any account
;; mechanism that serializes deposit and withdrawal transactions, for
;; example, the version of make-account in the text above.

(define (transfer from-account to-account amount)
  ((from-account 'withdraw) amount)
