Balance could take many values if the three transactions are allowed to
happen concurrently.

It could be 110, 80 or 50 if one of them mutates the balance variable
at the end depending on which one manages to finish last. It could also
be that 2 of them work concurrently and the resultant value is processed
by the third transaction.
